\section{Introduction}
System for controlling a marklin track using a Raspberry Pi. A custom shield has been added to provide a hardware interface between the Gleisbox and the Raspberry Pi. PiCANS88 is used to provide communication between the Gleisbox and Rocrail. Rocrail is used as the control software to control the model railway. A S88N interface is also present to allow feedback of train positions to Rocrail.
