A button can be connected to the system to simplify the process of shutting the system down. First of all, a pushbutton must be connected between GPIO3 (header pin 5) and GND (e.g. header pin 6). \\

Next, the following script must be installed:

\begin{verbatim}
	git clone https://github.com/Howchoo/pi-power-button.git
	
	./pi-power-button/script/install
\end{verbatim}

Uninstalling the script can be done via:

\begin{verbatim}
	./pi-power-button/script/uninstall
\end{verbatim}

Note: warning about pull-up resistor can be neglected.
